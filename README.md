# Data-Wrangling-and-Visualization
With this data set we want to explore 2 different genes associated with breast and liver cancer to identify their levels of expression. Specifically, I will focus on BARD1 for breast cancer and CTNNB1 for liver cancer. I will load the data and necessary libraries and then continue with visual representation of the data. Visual representation is helpful to interpret that data across various samples. Furthermore, I will continue with T-tests that will provide p-values for the chosen genes, allowing us to understand the statistical signifance of the gene expression. Through these data wrangling and visualization techniques along with supporting literature, we should be able to further evaluate the significance of each gene and its expression. The question I would like to ask is if there is an overlap between the genes and their expression in other cancers? In conclusion, based on the bar graphs and T-tests there is significant expression of BRAD1 in breast cancer and CTNNB1 in liver cancer. An interesting point I came across is that CTNNB1 gene expression could be significant in breast cancer as after running the code for gene expression among the BRCA samples, the p-value for LIHC was greater.
